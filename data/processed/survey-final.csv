275,strategy,"I used a strategy where I created relationships between lights, framing it as they ""like each other"" or not. If they liked each other, they would be on together.

If given longer than 5 seconds then I would have worked it out sequentially, for example if red was on then that meant the order including red would be on, off, off, on, on.
