# Locally-structured statistical learning experiment

This is code for a statistical learning experiment where people need to chain together local statistical dependencies that they learn well. It is framed as a series of rumors spreading through a population. Participants can only see whether two people in the population know about a rumor at a time, then they need to make predictions about whether one person knows about a rumor based on whether someone else does.

This experiment relies on [JsPsych 7](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/). Unfortunately, the timer in the speeded condition does not yet work on Firefox.
